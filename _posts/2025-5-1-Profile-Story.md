title: From Algorithms to Adventures: My Journey in Data Science
---

Hi, I'm Sue Ye (Shuqin Ye) — a data scientist, AI enthusiact, and curious builder at heart.

Over the past 11+ years, I've worked across industries—from travel and fashion to e-commerce and tech—using data to solve complex problems and deliver real-world impact. I've built machine learning systems that power personalized recommendations, NLP solutions that understand human language at scale, and deep learning models that uncover trends before they go viral.

At Stitch Fix, I improved a custom recommendation model that drove $12M+ in annual revenue. At Vrbo, I rebuilt the homepage recommender and lifted CTR by 43%. At Apple, I matched users with the right help content using NLP. And now, I'm venturing deeper into the world of Large Language Models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), bringing these cutting-edge technologies to real-life applications.

### Why I do what I do

To me, data science is more than models and metrics—it's about empowering people with better tools, smarter experiences, and more meaningful interactions. Whether it’s recommending the perfect vacation rental, forecasting fashion trends, or helping someone plan their dream itinerary through an AI travel assistant I recently built, I find joy in seeing the direct impact of my work.

I love bringing different parts of a project together—tying strategy to engineering, working closely with diverse teams, and mentoring newer teammates along the way.

### What's next?

I'm currently exploring contractor and AI consultant roles while developing personal AI tools and apps that bring value to everyday users. I'm especially excited about applications of LLMs and RAG for personalized knowledge access, decision support, and storytelling.

If you're working on something in this space—or if you're just curious—let's connect.
